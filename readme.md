## 💡 Project Description

A chaotic productivity tool that uses guilt-tripping, absurd humor, and psychological warfare to keep users from procrastinating. Detects inactivity and bombards the user with traps and motivation until they return to work.

---

## 🧠 The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People are slacking off too peacefully. There aren’t enough psychological consequences for procrastination. Where's the mental pressure? Where's the digital chaos?

---

## 🧪 The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We created a system that rewards focus with compliments and punishes procrastination with red bars, annoying sound effects, fake warnings, and infinite guilt-trap tabs. It doesn't just monitor—you feel it.
